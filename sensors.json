  "Velocity and Acceleration": "\nMeasuring force and motion is part of many Go Forth and Measure projects, and there are a number of sensors you can use for this purpose. The accelerometers available for your use are pictured in Fig. 2 and described in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: List of accelerometers and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) available in the Instrument Library. All items are in the Accelerometers schedule except the WDSS. Please make sure to use sufficiently high sample rate for impulse experiments, ideally at least 10 points on every acceleration peak.\n\n| Code | Name                                | Specifications                                                                                                                 | Comments                                                                                                                                             |\n| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|  ACC     | Vernier 25-g accelerometer              | Range: \u00b1245 m/s2 (\u00b125g) Accuracy: \u00b12.45 m/s2 (\u00b10.25g) Resolution: 0.16 m/s2                                                        | Useful for impact studies, one-axis only.
